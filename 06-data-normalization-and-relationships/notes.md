# Notes

## UNION vs JOIN

1. UNION clause combines multiple result sets into one result set by appending ROWS
   JOIN clause merges multiple tables into one result set by appending COLUMNS

2. UNION clause combines similar result sets i.e. result sets with the same number of columns returned by appending the rows.
